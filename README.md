# 🚦 Traffic Violation Summary Report

This project is a **dashboard and analysis tool** to summarize traffic violations in India by **location**, **violation type**, and **time of day**. It helps authorities identify high-risk zones, monitor offense patterns, and visualize hotspots.

## 📊 Project Features

- Summarize traffic violations by:
  - Location
  - Type of violation
  - Hour of the day
- Visualizations using bar charts, line graphs, and interactive maps
- Geospatial heatmap for violation hotspots (if latitude/longitude available)
- Ready-to-use with any traffic violation dataset (CSV format)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly Express (for maps)
- Jupyter Notebook
